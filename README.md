# Washing-Machine-Optimization-using-Genetic-Algorithm

## Introduction
This project examines vibrational characteristics of a 2D horizontal axis washing machine in both transient and steady state. A simulink model is developed to analyze the forces developed and the vibrations caused. To reduce the vibrations and improve the design proposal, an optimization scheme called Genetic Algorithms is utilized. 
This work is inspired from [Dynamic modeling of a horizontal washing machine and optimization of vibration characteristics using Genetic Algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957415813000974) by Pınar Boyraz and Mutlu Gündüz
